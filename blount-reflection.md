#GPS 1.1 - Reflection

What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Feature branches were confusing becasue I did not understand the purpose of them.


What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The purpose of switching branches during changes and the way git is used in the workplace. From what I understand now there is one person who monitors the merging from the closests feature branch to master and the code that makes it that far is checked pretty thoroughly.


What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked about fetch and merge becasue I didn't understand how they related to pull and push. It seems that when you pull from master to your current branch it automatically merges the information but when yoe fetch and merge it breaks the steps into two. After asking this question another question came up about what is the difference between creating a directory on your local repository and then initializing that repo. When you type git remote -v you get the remote branches located with that branch. When you create repos this was you don't have a master branch so you can't use the git push origin master or pull or many of the origin remotes. You have to set your remote.

What still confuses you about git?
I am still a little confused about remote branches and setting an origin but I am a little more familiar today than I am yesterday.


How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was really helpful, I think that thinking through the problem with someone with around my level of understanding because we both mess up on similar parts and by trying to work through the misunderstanding and getting guidance it leads us in the right direction.
