#GPS 1.1

##REFLECTION

1. What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was struggling with understanding the difference between the Fetch & Merge commands as compared to the Pull command. Also remembering the git workflow.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The concepts that I listed above were clarifies and working through the three stages of git workflow multiple times is helping ingrain it into my memory. We also got the experience working in a tree structure rather than just off one branch. Finally, this gave us the opportunity to work as a team while using Github to check and merge other work to different branches as collaborators on a project.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

We asked our pairing guide anytime we got stuck in the process or if she could clarify certain process’ for us. In the future I think it would be better practice to do more research during the session to get these answers met rather than relying on the guide.

4. What still confuses you about git?

I am not so much confused as I feel inexperienced, which likely won’t change til I can complete the Git
workflow process without looking up any notes.

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

I think my first experience went very well, my partner was very amicable, curious, and easy to work with. The project did take us way more time than we anticipated, almost 3 hours in total to complete. In the future I will take it upon myself to review the questions and write down a step by step outline of what needs to be completed for the GPS’ so that I have a better understanding of what we are being asked and can complete the project with my pair in a more efficient manner.
